I've always loved video as a medium, but i've also found it very intimidating and challenging. From everything to creating the initial concept, to the actual shooting of film, and then editing, it's a lot. However, when I've pushed myself to produce something, anything, it's always very rewarding. There's just something about moving images that immediatly reels me in (no pun intended).
